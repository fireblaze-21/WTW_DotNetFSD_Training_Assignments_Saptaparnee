‚úÖ What is Content Negotiation?

Content Negotiation is a mechanism defined in the HTTP specification (RFC 7231) that allows clients and servers to agree on the best format for data to be exchanged.

In simple terms, Content Negotiation is the process of determining the best response format (like JSON, XML, etc.) based on the client‚Äôs request.

üéØ Purpose:

To provide data in the most appropriate format requested by the client.

To support multiple data formats without changing the API endpoints.

üí° How It Works

When a client sends an HTTP request, it can include the Accept header to indicate the desired response media type (e.g., application/json, application/xml, etc.).


Content Negotiation in .NET Web API

In ASP.NET Web API, content negotiation is handled automatically using MediaTypeFormatters.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components in .NET:
Component	Description
MediaTypeFormatter	Abstract class to serialize/deserialize objects.
JsonMediaTypeFormatter	Handles JSON formatting.
XmlMediaTypeFormatter	Handles XML formatting.

.NET Web API selects the formatter based on:

The Accept header of the request.

Supported formatters registered in the pipeline.

Default format if no match is found.







What Does "Deprecating an API" Mean?

Deprecating an API version means notifying users that a specific version of the API is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in the future. It allows clients time to migrate to a newer version.

The key is to do it gracefully ‚Äî with clear communication, support, and minimal disruption.

üéØ Why Deprecate Gracefully?

To maintain trust with API consumers.

To avoid breaking existing client applications.

To ensure a smooth transition to newer API versions.

üîÑ Graceful Deprecation Process (Step-by-Step)
1. Use API Versioning

In ASP.NET Core, use the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning package to manage API versions:

2. Mark the API Version as Deprecated

Use the [ApiVersion] attribute with Deprecated = true on your controller:


3. Add Deprecation Warnings in HTTP Response Headers

Include custom headers like this in your middleware or action filter:


4. Update Documentation

Clearly mark deprecated versions in Swagger (e.g., via Swashbuckle).

Add migration guides in your API docs.

Use [Obsolete] attribute if needed for clients consuming your SDKs.

5. Notify Consumers

Send email announcements to API users.

Publish deprecation notices in changelogs or developer portals.

Provide timelines and guidance on migrating to newer versions.


What are Repository and Service Patterns?

These are design patterns that help in building clean, maintainable, and testable applications, especially in layered architectures like ASP.NET Core MVC or Web API.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Pattern
‚úÖ Purpose:

Abstracts the data access logic.

Acts as a middle layer between the database (EF Core or any ORM) and the business logic.

üéØ Responsibilities:

Communicate with the database (CRUD operations).

Hide complex querying logic from business layer.

Promote loose coupling.


public interface IProductRepository
{
    Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync();
    Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task AddAsync(Product product);
    void Update(Product product);
    void Delete(Product product);
}


public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;
    public ProductRepository(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync()
        => await _context.Products.ToListAsync();

    public async Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id)
        => await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);

    public async Task AddAsync(Product product)
        => await _context.Products.AddAsync(product);

    public void Update(Product product)
        => _context.Products.Update(product);

    public void Delete(Product product)
        => _context.Products.Remove(product);
}



Service Pattern (aka Business Layer)
‚úÖ Purpose:

Contains business logic.

Acts as an intermediary between the controller and the repository.

Helps in unit testing and keeping controllers thin.

üéØ Responsibilities:

Process and validate data.

Call one or multiple repositories.

Handle business rules before data hits the DB.

public interface IProductService
{
    Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllProductsAsync();
    Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id);
    Task CreateProductAsync(Product product);
    Task UpdateProductAsync(Product product);
    Task DeleteProductAsync(int id);
}


public class ProductService : IProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository _repository;
    public ProductService(IProductRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllProductsAsync()
        => await _repository.GetAllAsync();

    public async Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id)
        => await _repository.GetByIdAsync(id);

    public async Task CreateProductAsync(Product product)
        => await _repository.AddAsync(product);

    public async Task UpdateProductAsync(Product product)
        => _repository.Update(product);

    public async Task DeleteProductAsync(int id)
    {
        var product = await _repository.GetByIdAsync(id);
        if (product != null)
        {
            _repository.Delete(product);
        }
    }
}
