a. What is the Object class in .NET Framework?
Object is the base class from which all types in .NET derive.

It’s defined in the System namespace and provides basic methods such as:

ToString() – Returns a string that represents the object.

Equals() – Checks object equality.

GetHashCode() – Returns a hash code for the object.

GetType() – Gets the runtime type of the object.



b. What is Boxing and Unboxing?
These are operations that convert between value types and object types:

Boxing
Converting a value type (e.g., int, bool) into an object.

Unboxing
Extracting the value type from the object.


c. Difference between int.Parse() and Convert.ToInt32()
Feature	int.Parse()	Convert.ToInt32()
Source Type	Only works with string	Works with multiple types
Null Input	Throws ArgumentNullException	Returns 0
Invalid Format	Throws FormatException	Also throws FormatException
Use Case	Strict parsing from strings	Flexible conversion (e.g. from bool, object, string)
